# Phills_Assignment

## This assignment will be divided in 3 parts.

###	HTML/CSS layout of the application You will need to perform the following task:

*	Create HTML layout of the Trivia application and style it for Desktop, Tablet, Mobile platforms. Use forked repo for reference and replicate the visuals from scratch in a clean HTML/CSS file.
*	Create a github repo for your project. Read about it [HERE](https://hackernoon.com/step-by-step-guide-to-push-your-first-project-on-github-fec1dce574f)
*	You will need to use mobile first approach. Create styles starting from the mobile environment, afterwards Tablet, and finally Desktop (not vice versa, this is important) Read about it [HERE](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp)
*	The best way to work with HTML is with [CODEPEN](https://codepen.io/) - Use it instead of the editor and afterwards copy the layout to the editor and commit it to git.
*	Commit to git often, add meaningful explanations to your commits so other developers would be able to understand what you were doing.
